# Big O notation

Big O notaion is a mathematical notation that describes the mimiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

In computer science, big O notation is used to classidy algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements gro as the input size grows.

| Notation | Name | Example |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| 0(1)     | constant | Finding the median vlaue for a sorted array of numbers; Calculating (-1)ⁿ; Using a constant-size lookup table; |
| O(α(n)) | inverse Ackermann function | Amortized complexity per operation for the Disjoint-set data structure |
